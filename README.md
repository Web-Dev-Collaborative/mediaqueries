# CSS conf media queries prsentation

To contribute to this project you'll need node install, if you don't have it you can [get NodeJs here](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you're on MacOS, I recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install NPM/Node.

Then you can install the project dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

You'll only ned to install the dependencies once.

To work on the project run:

```
gulp
```

This will start a browsersync for instant browser refresh, and will listen to any change on the HTML or the SCSS.
